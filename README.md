# Maze Solver

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
This is my attempt at a maze solving program, heavily inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rop0W4QDOUI&t=24s). I will be working on and improving this at my leisure. If you have questions or comments, go right ahead!

TODO:
- FIRST: Do not hardcode filename of maze
- Write a program to make a post request to http://hereandabove.com/maze/mazeorig.form.html to get new files of variable sizes
- Make it so it is not required for the start and end to be on the top and bottom respectively
>>>>>>> Stashed changes
